# EpiVeto

Epiveto is an Internet website for a veterinary clinic. The website's aim is to promote the veterinary clinic online.



## Tech Stack

**Client:** JavaScript, Html, CSS

**Server:** PHP, MySql, CKEditor


## Usage/Examples

### All site

The all website is responsive, each page can be seen on a desktop or a mobile phone.

### Home page

The carousel is made with JS and Html. The client wants to be able to change the photos, so I have added a Table in the DB. This Table can be accessed by the admin page.  


The carousel has dots and navigate arrows, it can be controlled (play/pause, previous/next) by the user.

### Equipe/Collaborateur pages

The Equipe and Collaborateur pages are related to the TABLE Equipe, which can be modified in the admin Interface.

The Collaborateur page adapts to the presence or not of optional fields. The result remains neat and elegant regardless of the number of filled fields.

### Honoraire page

This page is related to the honoraires Table and can be modified in the admin Interface. At the top of the section, the update date is automatically modified when the admin modifies a field. 

### Conseils pages

These pages are related to the conseils Table. Each article is related to one or more category. This structure allows me to filter articles related to cats, dogs...

I have added CKEditor in the admin Interface for the articles, because as they are long texts, the client wanted to be able to customise them adding title or bold for example.
